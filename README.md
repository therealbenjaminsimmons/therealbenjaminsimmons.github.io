# About Me
## My Interests
I love spending time with my wife and my son when I'm not doing homework or working. I do stand-up comedy in the local Raleigh area and I'm host of the _**Pass The Mic Comedy Show**_. My favorite sports to watch are professional football, baseball, and MMA.   
## Websites I Recommend
[Goodnights Comedy Club](https://www.goodnightscomedy.com/) - I find that Goodnights Comedy Club is the best comedy venue in the Raleigh area and Goodnights books the best quality big name and local comics for their comedy shows.  
[Nike Dunk](https://www.nike.com/w/mens-dunk-shoes-90aohznik1zy7ok) - Nike releases their Dunk line up all throughout the year on their website and this gets you straight to the landing page for their Nike Dunks. 

## Post Malone Concert
My wife and I are going to the Post Malone concert at Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek and we want to make a few purchases while we're at the concert. First, we decide that we're going to go to the Post Malone concert in Oct at Coastal Credit Union Music Park at Walnut Creek and get money from our bank account. Second, we go online to Ticketmasters website to buy the tickets for the Post Malone concert. Third, we have to decide what three items we want to purchase while being at the concert. Finally, we end up buying a parking spot, a t-shirt souvenior, and enjoyed some ice cold beer and food from the food vendors.
