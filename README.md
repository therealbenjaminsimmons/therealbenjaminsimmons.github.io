# About Me
## My Interests
I love spending time with my wife and my son when I'm not doing homework or working. I do stand-up comedy in the local Raleigh area and I'm host of the _**Pass The Mic Comedy Show**_. My favorite sports to watch are professional football, baseball, and MMA.   
## Websites I Recommend
-[Goodnights Comedy Club](https://www.goodnightscomedy.com/)- I find that Goodnights Comedy Club is the best comedy venue in the Raleigh area and Goodnights book the best quality big name and local comics for their shows.  
-[Nike Dunk](https://www.nike.com/w/mens-dunk-shoes-90aohznik1zy7ok)- Nike releases their Dunk line up all throughout the year on their website and this gets you straight to the landing page for their Nike Dunks.
